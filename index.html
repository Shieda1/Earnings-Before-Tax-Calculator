    Insert the information in the form and the calculator will determine the pre-tax income<br> 
    What is the pre-tax income?<br>
    the pre-tax income (EBT) is the remaining earnings after all operating and non operating expenses except for the taxes have been accounted for.<br>
    How to calculate pre-tax income?<br>
    To calculate pre-tax income you should use the following formula:<br>
    pre-tax income (EBT) = operating income (EBIT) - interest expense<br>
    where:<br>
    EBIT = revenue - cost of goods sold (COGS) - operating expenses<br>
    Example: company x has $13,000,000 in revenue, $6,000,000 in cost of goods sold, $2,300,000 of operating expenses and $670,000 worth of interest expense, calculate the pre-tax income?<br>
    First we should calculate the EBIT:<br>
    EBIT = revenue - cost of goods sold - operating expenses<br>
    EBIT = $13,000,000 - $6,000,000 - $2,300,000<br>
    EBIT = $4,700,000<br>
    now let's calculate the pre-tax income:<br>
    pre-tax income = operating income - interest expense<br>
    pre-tax income = $4,700,000 - $670,000<br>
    pre-tax income = $4,030,000<br>
    Why use pre-tax income?<br>
    The pre-tax income is used because it provides an insight into the firm's financial performance before the impact of taxes. It is also used to measure the business performance and health.<br>
